			<h3>Year-round Destination</h3>
			<p>Each season on the south central Oregon coast has its own pleasures. Cool down in the summer with sunny, warm days and the breath of a breeze from the ocean. Revel in the continuing warm and sunny days of autumn. Watch the beauty and fury of storms in the winter, and enjoy the return of spring with wild flowers,  ebbing tides and cleansing showers of liquid sunshine. 
<br><br>
The small village of Yachats offers an impressive array of restaurants, regular entertainment, quaint shopping and beautiful, broad beaches. Walk many of the nature trails or visit spectacular Cape Perpetua, about a mile away.</p>

			<h3>Loaded with Luxery</h3>
			<p>Start your experience with ocean, forest, and creek views on an acre and a half tucked into a valley with wooded hillsides behind. Come into the gathering room facing the ocean with two walls of windows and a comfy place to sit with your coffee and have your specialty breakfast each morning. Luxuriate in your bath with natural bath products and enjoy your private deck. Visit the cozy sitting room on the second floor to read, do computer work, or just be alone.
<br><br>
